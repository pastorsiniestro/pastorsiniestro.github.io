    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p><q><Sinister></q> can represent something outside the norm or breaking from tradition. This can be seen as a strength for those who reject conventional paths in favor of truth or deeper understanding.  Despite our unconventional name, the Sinister Church is not about causing harm or promoting negative behavior. Instead, it is a community for truth-seekers. 
      We help our members discover the light within them by embracing the shadows around us and offer a welcoming space for those who feel disconnected from traditional churches.
     After all, darkness is the absense of light, but shadows are created by shining light.</p>
